<time>20 Feb 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>American actress Zoey Deutch has been working since she was a child. She got her start in the industry playing supporting roles on the first season of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. She eventually landed a part on the CW’s smash drama Ringer.</p><p>Her popularity rose after she was included in the Netflix comedy Set It Up. The Netflix original series The Politician gave her another leading role. In the romantic comedy Why Him, Zoey co-starred with Bryan Cranston and James Franco.</p><p>In the forthcoming satirical feature film Not Okay, Zoey Deutch will play the lead. The actress is set to play a lady in need of care who fakes a trip away, only to get herself into serious difficulty. However, she suddenly becomes the center of attention, but not in the way she had hoped.</p><p>Fans have been waiting for Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell to return for a Set It Up sequel, but the actress has stated that this is not currently in the works.</p><h2>Who Exactly Is Zoey Deutch Dating at The Moment?</h2><p>Most of Zoey’s carefully manicured social media profile consists of shots from behind the scenes on film or stunning holiday photographs, but admirers who look closely may notice hints of her personal life.</p><p>Zoey’s on-screen connection with men like Glen Powell and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Dylan O’Brien</a> is evident, but she’s been dating actor Jimmy Tatro since 2021. In February 2021, when Jimmy paid respect to Zoey on Valentine’s Day, dating rumors began to circulate.</p><p>Then, in May, the pair was seen on vacation with Nina Dobrev and Shaun White, who are clearly very much in love. They were most certainly an item by November when he wished her a happy birthday. Both of them grew raised in Los Angeles, so they already have that in common.</p><p>Like Jimmy, she enjoys a good laugh, and he got his start in the entertainment industry as a YouTuber whose viral skits frequently included celebs like Emily Osment, David Henrie, and more. He has since made guest appearances on sitcoms like 22 Jump Street and American Vandal, as well as movies like Grown Ups 2 and American Vandal.</p><p>Jimmy is currently the main attraction on the Home Economics show. In an earlier interview with Lights, Camera, Barstool, Zoey referenced Jimmy and stated that he was “embarrassed” by her character’s antics in Not Okay. She explained, “I was like, I’m acting, buddy.”</p><p>In this satirical film, a young lady goes to Paris on the sham that she would be attending a writing retreat, only to find herself in the thick of a media storm that will alter the course of her life forever.</p><p>Something From Tiffany’s is Zoey’s most recent film, in which she portrays the role of <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Rachel Meyer</a>, a woman who accidentally inherits an engagement diamond. On December 9, 2022, the romantic comedy debuted on Prime Video amid rave reviews.</p><p>Fans are happy for Zoey whether she is in a relationship on or off the television.</p><p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Is Anyone Familiar with Who Zoey Deutch Is Dating?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/zoey-dutch-and-jimmy-tatro-1-81022-2895fccdff59400596c95b49d542bc25-1024x707.jpg alt="Is anyone familiar with who Zoey Deutch is dating?" width=1024 height=707 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The actress from the film The Politician is currently in a relationship with actor Jimmy Tatro. The Disney star and her boyfriend recently made a pit stop at a coffee shop to pick up some refreshments and were photographed by photographers.</p><p>The pair were seen strolling the streets of West Hollywood, California, in casual attire. At first, the actor and Zoey Deutch kept their romance low-key, but eventually, they made it Instagram official.</p><p>Tatro uploaded many images with Deutch on Valentine’s Day, a day she clearly felt was appropriate for the gesture. He accompanied the photos with a kind statement, explaining that he was using Valentine’s Day as an opportunity to share some previously unseen material featuring his girlfriend Zoey.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJyRqbavs46wn6hlmah6u7vEsmSdnaWpsKl5w5qroqaXZH55gJJwZg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-zoey-deutch-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-zoey-deutch-dating.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-zoey-deutch-dating.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-zoey-deutch-dating.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-zoey-deutch-dating.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-zoey-deutch-dating.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./amy-schumer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./amy-schumer.html>Who is the Husband of American Comedian Turned Actress, Amy Schumer?
