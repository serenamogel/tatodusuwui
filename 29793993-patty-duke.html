I wish Patty had had a better chance and reputation, in light of her eventually diagnosed illness and related troubles, to have garnered a memorable career on the big screen, instead of the TV show, "VOTD," and the latter TV work alone. But she did eventually help so many people living with bipolar illness and advocating for/educating them and their loved ones, during an era when that was often still not discussed much and frowned on.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 60</td><td class=timestamp><span>June 16, 2022 2:52 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>I grew up watching Patty Duke.

It was directed by Lamont Johnson who directed Patty in the highly acclaimed TV movie My Sweet Charlie (1970) for which she won an Emmy.

I even see the resemblance. And then all of the speculation about Desi Arnaz Junior. I‚Äôve read that Sean seems to be cool with it and has relationships with all three ‚Äúdads.‚Äù But Patty is very dismissive of Michael Tell in the book and obviously she was not truthful. Did she ever publicly apologize or explain? I assume she was just trying to give Sean some stability as a child. I remember hearing about all this as a teenager. Patty and Astin were everywhere at one point, I recall seeing them on the Dinah Shore show and thinking they made an odd couple; John was very solicitous and fatherly and called her Anna, it all seemed strange to me.
