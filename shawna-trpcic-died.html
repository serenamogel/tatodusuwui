Her love for science fiction and comic books fueled her interest in costume design, as she saw it as a way to create art for the human body, crafting multidimensional characters.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-909 data-method=placement-service></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shawna_Trpcic_Died_What_Was_Her_Cause_of_Death></span>Shawna Trpcic Died: What Was Her Cause of Death?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shawna Trpcic, the talented costume designer known for her work on iconic projects like Star Wars: The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, Power Rangers, and Firefly, has sadly passed away. <strong>Her daughter confirmed this news to The Hollywood Reporter (THR)</strong>. <strong>At this time, the details surrounding her passing have not been disclosed, leaving many in the entertainment industry and her fans in mourning.

She was family. Although BOBF was the first full show we worked on together. The first time we actually met; she suited me up as Boba Fett for his return in Mando S2 as a stand-in. I geeked out so hard and she said I showed come work on more SW stuff. We kept that memory (and secret) for years until we ended up back together working on more Star Wars projects. She would call me the new original Boba because i was apparently the first person to wear it in years. I owe her forever for that. This hurts. This really hurts.</strong></p><p><strong>RIP love.
