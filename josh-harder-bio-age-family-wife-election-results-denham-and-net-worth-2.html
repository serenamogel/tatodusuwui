The Democratic applicant, Josh Harder, is attempting to remove a GOP officeholder in a crusade that transformed into something of submission on Silicon Valley.</p><p>Harder, who most as of late filled in as a VP at Bessemer Venture Partners, is engaging the four-term Republican occupant, Jeff Denham, however, the race remains a photo finish, as per the Associated Press.</p><p>Denham, with 50.6 percent of the vote, has a lead of around 1,300 votes as of Wednesday morning. Albeit 100 percent of regions have detailed outcomes, decision authorities should represent non-attendant and temporary polls in a procedure that could last some time. Neither Harder nor Denham has yielded.</p><p>In any case, Harder was not only a financial speculator. His whole race was characterized by his investment past, with Denham giving him a role as a Silicon Valley insider who was in charge of Bessemer portfolio organizations that moved employments abroad.</p><p>Denham, then again, considered himself the nearest thing to something contrary to an investor — a rancher — in a country region fixated on Modesto.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=josh-harder-jeff-denham></span>Josh Harder Jeff Denham<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Harder beat Jeff Denham in the race for the House seat in District 10 after a refreshed vote check Tuesday night gave the Turlock local an impossible lead.

He brought about $870,000 up in the initial three months of the year and has about $1.3 million in real money available as he plans to run for re-appointment in 2020.</p><p>“These numbers are not ordinary, regular or schedule,” said Mike Lynch, a Modesto-based Democratic political strategist who doesn’t work for Harder. “It’s exceptional the way he’s gotten straight down to business and never halted.”</p><p>Harder’s locale is one of seven in California that Democrats flipped from Republicans in 2018 and it’s turning out to be a key battleground in 2020. He crushed four-term Rep. Jeff Denham, R-Turlock, in November and four Republicans have declared to restore the Central Valley locale to the GOP.</p><h2 style=text-align:center><span class=ez-toc-section id=frequently-asked-questions-about-josh-harder></span>Frequently Asked Questions About Josh Harder<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-is-harder></span>Who is Harder?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Josh is one of America’s best-known and loved politicians, educators, and venture capitalists.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-old-is-harder></span>How old is Harder?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>He is 33 years of age as of 2019.
