The use of latex paint normally does not need the use of additional sealers. Applying a clear topcoat over a latex-painted surface, on the other hand, aids in sealing and protecting the surface area. Clear sealants may also be used to offer an extra layer of protection to faux-painted walls.
Is it possible to apply a clear coat over latex paint in the same way?

実は慶應卒の才女であるのは有名ですが、父や事実婚状態の男性も凄まじいエリートであります。
今日は、コムアイさんの父親や、夫（入籍はせず）について書いてみたいと思います。
また、過去にインスタにアップして炎上したニップレス事件などについても触れてみたいと思います。
コムアイの父親は輿亮。アメリカンフットボールの元選手、指導者、解説者、および光学技術者 コムアイは、父親と母親、弟の4人家族です。
母親はすでに他界されており、現在在命の家族はコムアイさんと合わせて3人です。
ふしぎちゃんでマイペースなイメージのあるコムアイさんですが、実は弟のいる姉さんだったんですね！
コムアイさんの父親は、アメリカンフットボールの元選手、指導者、解説者、および光学技術者の輿亮（こしまこと）さんです。
名前 輿亮 生年月日 1959年11月10日 出身地 東京都世田谷区 出身大学 東京大学 アメフト好きの日本人なら知らない人はいないほどの、アメフト界の大物です。
コムアイさんは慶應出身の秀才として知られてますが、父は東大卒の超絶エリートで、偏差値の高さは父親譲りだったようです。
コムアイは弟もアメフト選手！母は19歳の頃にガンで死去 コムアイさんの父が日本アメフト界の大物なのは有名ですが、実は弟もアメフト選手です。
弟の名前は「輿将央」さんで、父と同じくアメフトの道に進んでいます。
まだまだ若いですが、今後もアメフト界で名の知れた人物になる可能性もあります。
コムアイさんの母は、彼女が19歳の頃（2011年）にガンで死去されています。
2年間の闘病生活の末に亡くなったそうです。
当時、音楽活動を始めたばかりだったコムアイさんは、後悔すると分かっていながら母親の看病よりも自分の音楽活動を優先させていました。
母が亡くなることは覚悟していたようで、それがわかった上で音楽に没頭し成功したのは、何か深いですね。
コムアイの夫は映画監督で文化人類学者の太田光海。入籍せず事実婚の理由。第一子の子供は秀才？ 2023年に事実婚をしたこと発表したコムアイさん。
パートナーとなった相手は映画監督で文化人類学者の太田光海さんです。
