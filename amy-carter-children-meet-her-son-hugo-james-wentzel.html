Keep reading for more details.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Amy Carter Net Worth: How Much Is She Worth?</a></strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h3><strong>Amy Carter Biography</strong></h3><p>Born October 19, 1967, in Plains, Georgia, Amy’s life has been extraordinary right from the beginning. Her early years in the Plains and subsequent move to the Governor’s Mansion in Atlanta set the stage for a remarkable journey that would eventually lead her to the White House.</p><p>At the age of nine, Amy entered the White House when her father was elected President in 1976, drawing significant media attention as one of the few young children to reside there since the Kennedy era. Throughout her four years in the White House, Amy attended public schools in Washington, starting at Stevens Elementary School and later transferring to Rose Hardy Middle School. She brought a touch of companionship to the White House with her Siamese cat, Misty Malarky Ying Yang, becoming the last feline occupant until Socks, owned by President Bill Clinton, arrived. Furthermore, Amy received an elephant as a gift, symbolizing the diverse experiences and connections she encountered during her time in the nation’s capital.</p><p>Following her father’s presidency, Amy moved to Atlanta and completed her senior year of high school at Woodward Academy in College Park, Georgia. While her academic journey at Brown University faced challenges resulting in academic dismissal in 1987, Amy remained undeterred. She later earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from the Memphis College of Art, nurturing her passion for artistic expression. Subsequently, she pursued a master’s degree in art history from Tulane University in New Orleans, solidifying her commitment to the world of art.</p><p>Amy Carter’s life took on an additional dimension as she emerged as a prominent activist, lending her voice to causes close to her heart. During the 1980s and early 1990s, she actively participated in sit-ins and protests, focusing on altering U.S. foreign policy concerning South African apartheid and Central America. One notable incident was her arrest during a demonstration at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in 1986, where she, alongside activist Abbie Hoffman and others, protested against CIA recruitment on campus. Amy’s subsequent acquittal in a highly publicized trial showcased the effectiveness of her defence, emphasizing the necessity of challenging unlawful activities perpetrated by the CIA.</p><p>Parallel to her activism, Amy also made meaningful contributions to her father’s literary endeavours. She illustrated “The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer,” a children’s book published in 1995, which exemplified her artistic talents and collaborated with her father’s storytelling abilities. Additionally, Amy found personal fulfilment through her relationships, marrying James Gregory Wentzel in 1996 and later John Joseph “Jay” Kelly in 2007. These relationships brought her the joys of motherhood, as she welcomed her sons Hugo James Wentzel in 1999 and another son in 2010.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>While Amy Carter has opted for a relatively low profile since the late 1990s, she remains connected to her family’s legacy through her role as a member of the board of counsellors at the Carter Center. In this capacity, she actively supports the organization’s mission, which promotes human rights and diplomacy, aligning closely with her father’s values.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><h3><strong>Amy Carter Children: Meet Her Son, Hugo James Wentzel</strong></h3><p>Carter was first married to computer consultant James Gregory Wentzel. They had a son together named Hugo James Wentzel. Hugo was born in 1999. There are however few details about him as Amy Carter keeps a low profile.</p><p>After divorcing from her ex-husband, Amy remarried again to John Joseph “Jay” Kelly in 2007. She had another son in 2010.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunCtzLJknJmiqbKzecKhoKWcopq7brnEnqtmoJWnerS7zWafrp%2BfYreiucSsZLCdnqnHpriO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famy-carter-children-meet-her-son-hugo-james-wentzel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2famy-carter-children-meet-her-son-hugo-james-wentzel.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2famy-carter-children-meet-her-son-hugo-james-wentzel.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2famy-carter-children-meet-her-son-hugo-james-wentzel.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famy-carter-children-meet-her-son-hugo-james-wentzel.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2famy-carter-children-meet-her-son-hugo-james-wentzel.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./avadirect-silent-gaming-pc-an-exercise-in-balance.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./avadirect-silent-gaming-pc-an-exercise-in-balance.html>AVADirect Silent Gaming PC: An Exercise in Balance</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./zana-marjanovic.html>Zana Marjanovic movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./zana-marjanovic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
