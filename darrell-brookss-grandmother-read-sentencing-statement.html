Darrell Brooks’s grandmother was present on Zoom during Darrell’s sentencing hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>During the sentencing hearing, she read a statement. Let’s discuss what she reads in the impact statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Darrell Brooks’s Grandmother Reads The Impact Statement</h2><p>She introduces herself and says her name is Dr.Mary Darlene Edwards. She is the grandmother of Darrell Edward Brooks, Jr, and she said she had two reasons to be present during this hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>One reason for her being present in the hearing was to apologize to the families who have lost their loved ones, including their sons, grandmothers, and other family members.&nbsp;</p><p>She says that she is devastated after the “<strong>overwhelming tragedy</strong>,” which was caused by her own grandson.&nbsp;</p><p>She further reads, “<strong>As a minister of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, I want to give you this promise from the scriptures, “Blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted</strong>.“</p><p>Her prayers are with the families who lost their loved ones, and she prayed that her grandson would not be like others who would drink poison and expect their enemy to die. “<strong>Unforgiveness is a horrible disease, just like mental illness</strong>,” she reads.&nbsp;</p><p>There were countless people who died in the unforgettable tragedy, and later, she says that she disowns her grandson while his mother disowns her son.&nbsp;</p><p>She added to her statement, saying that he is no more the father of his children and he has lost everything, including his mind and life, in this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>She further reads that whenever people see Brooks, they see a monster and but when she sees him, she sees her grandson, who she truly loved, and now he is in deep trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>She says, “<strong>Sadly, I have more than one generation of bipolar people in my family. More than once, I have heard them say, “People just won’t listen to us</strong>.”</p><p>In her further statement, she talks about Darrel’s condition as he has been facing bipolar disorder since he was 12. She prays that her grandson should get attention from medical centers and his illness should be treated.</p><p>While reading, she says that she is 80 years old and has served 47 years in the Gospel of Jesus Christ as an ordained minister. She also says that she won the “<strong>Thousand Points of Light Award</strong>” (107th) from George H.W Bush, Sr, former President.&nbsp;</p><p>She doesn’t boast by sharing this information, but she tells this because she cares for the people. Her work can be seen by visiting the Legacy Library at the University of Michigan.</p><p>A mental health clinic is being established in Detroit’s Ravendale Community church. She says she will do everything for people struggling with mental health issues.&nbsp;</p><p>She finishes her statement by praying to God as he will listen to the cries of those impacted by the tragedy. She added, “<strong>Again, it is my prayer that Darrell Edward Brooks, Jr. will get help and not punishment</strong>.”</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCwwKupnqScYq%2Bzu86kqqxll6eur7DMqKuhnaJiv6atw2aqnqakmruktc2gZKyskamyrrHNrWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdarrell-brookss-grandmother-read-sentencing-statement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdarrell-brookss-grandmother-read-sentencing-statement.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdarrell-brookss-grandmother-read-sentencing-statement.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdarrell-brookss-grandmother-read-sentencing-statement.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdarrell-brookss-grandmother-read-sentencing-statement.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdarrell-brookss-grandmother-read-sentencing-statement.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./froakie-pok-c3-a9mon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./froakie-pok-c3-a9mon.html>Froakie (Pokmon) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./when-bad-boys-began-martin-lawrence-was-the-top-dog.html>When Bad Boys Began, Martin Lawrence Was the Top Dog | Features</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./when-bad-boys-began-martin-lawrence-was-the-top-dog.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
