Hunt images</h2><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.idolnetworth.com/images/24/h-l-hunt-0.jpg alt="H. L. Hunt" title="H. L. Hunt" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Biography/Timeline</h2><span>1912</span><p>Hunt was educated at home. As a teenager, Hunt traveled to various places before settling in <a href=#>Arkansas</a>, where he was running a cotton plantation by 1912. He had a reputation as a math <a href=#>Prodigy</a> and was a gambler. It was said that after his cotton plantation was flooded, he turned his last $100 into more than $100,000, gambling in New Orleans. With his winnings, he purchased oil properties in the neighborhood of El Dorado, <a href=#>Arkansas</a>. He was generous to his employees, who in turn were loyal to him, informing him of rumors of a massive oil field to the south, in East Texasâ€”the East Texas Oil Field. In negotiations over cheese and crackers, at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, with the wild-catter who discovered the fieldâ€”"Dad" Joinerâ€”Hunt secured title to what was then the largest known oil deposit in the world, having agreed to pay only $1,000,000, and protect Mr. Joiner from liability for his many fraudulent transactions surrounding the property. In 1957 <i>Fortune</i> estimated that Hunt had a fortune of between U.S. $400 million and $700 million ($4.5 billion in 2011, adjusted for inflation), and was one of the eight <a href=#>richest</a> people in the United States. <a href=#>J. Paul Getty</a>, who was considered at the time to be the <a href=#>richest</a> private citizen in the world, said of Hunt: "In terms of extraordinary, independent wealth, there is only one manâ€”H. L. Hunt."</p><span>1914</span><p>He married Lyda Bunker of Lake Village, <a href=#>Arkansas</a> in November 1914, and remained married to her until her death in 1955. His seven children by her were: <a href=#>Margaret</a> (1915-2007), Haroldson ("Hassie," 1917-2005), Caroline (1923), Lyda (born and died in 1925), Nelson Bunker (1926-2014), <a href=#>william</a> Herbert (1929), and Lamar (1932-2006). Their home on White Rock Lake in Dallas was styled after Mount Vernon though much larger.</p><span>1925</span><p>While still married to Lyda, H. L. Hunt is said to have married Frania Tye of Tampa, <a href=#>Florida</a> in November 1925, using the name Franklin Hunt. Frania claimed to have discovered the bigamous nature of her marriage in 1934, and in a legal settlement in 1941, Hunt created trust funds for each of their four children and she signed a document stipulating that no legal marriage between them had ever existed. About the same time, she briefly married then divorced Hunt's employee, John Lee, taking the last name Lee for herself and her four children. Her four children by Hunt were: Howard (born 1926), Haroldina (1928), Helen (1930), and Hugh ("Hue," 1934). Frania Tye Lee died in 2002.</p><span>1957</span><p>Hunt supported and had children by Ruth Ray of Shreveport, <a href=#>Louisiana</a>, whom he met when she was a secretary in his Shreveport office. They married in 1957 after the death of Hunt's wife Lyda. His four children by her were: Ray (born 1943), June (1944), Helen (1949), and Swanee (1950). His youngest son, Ray Lee, ultimately inherited the <a href=#>Business</a>, and was a major supporter of <a href=#>President</a> George W. Bush.</p><span>1975</span><p>A scandal emerged in 1975, after his death, when it was discovered that he had had a hidden bigamous relationship, with his second wife living in New York. Nonetheless, Hunt was a member of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, and was a major financial contributor toward the establishment of the conservative <a href=#>Christian</a> evangelical Criswell College in Dallas, Texas.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.idolnetworth.com/images/play_game.png alt="More or less Game" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <a href=# class=btn>Play Game</a><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>American businesspeople in the oil industry</a> <a href=#>Texas Oil Boom people</a> <a href=#>1889 births</a> <a href=#>1974 deaths</a> <a href=#>Businesspeople from Arkansas</a> <a href=#>Businesspeople from Texas</a> <a href=#>Hunt family</a> <a href=#>John Birch Society members</a> <a href=#>People from Ramsey, Illinois</a> <a href=#>Sparkman-Hillcrest Memorial Park Cemetery burials</a> <a href=#>Texas Republicans</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeYYrlutNSnq2amlal6uLvRrZ9mbWJphHU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fh-l-hunt-net-worth-52474.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fh-l-hunt-net-worth-52474.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fh-l-hunt-net-worth-52474.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fh-l-hunt-net-worth-52474.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fh-l-hunt-net-worth-52474.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fh-l-hunt-net-worth-52474.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./liliane-rov-c3-a8re.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./liliane-rov-c3-a8re.html>Liliane Rovre movie reviews &amp;amp; film summaries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sanjana-ganesan-wikipedia-jasprit-bumrah-wife.html>Sanjana Ganesan Wikipedia Jasprit Bumrah Wife Age Gap</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sanjana-ganesan-wikipedia-jasprit-bumrah-wife.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
