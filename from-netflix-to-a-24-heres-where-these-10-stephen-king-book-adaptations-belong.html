<time>29 Mar 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=211 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Believe it or not, over 70 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Stephen King’s</strong></a> novels and novellas have already been adapted into movies or TV shows. You might be thinking “Well then, what else is there to adapt?” Ha, you’re funny.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=415 data-current-count=415 data-injectable=true>As one of the most prolific writers of our time, King, who is 76 at the time of this writing, has churned out more works of fiction than most authors can hope to accomplish in three lifetimes. At this very moment, he probably has a novel already in the publication process and another one on deck. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">That’s how it’s been since the mid-70s</a> and that’ll likely be his process for years to come, if we’re lucky.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>Because he has his very own private creative genius working overtime in his head, the stuff King puts to the page is usually tailor-made for adaptations. As it stands, there are still dozens of novels or novellas that still need the live-action treatment. Some of them, like The Talisman, are already in development with the Duffer brothers from Stranger Things attached, but others are in need of some love; they’re like Little League johnnies shouting “Put me in, coach! Put me in!”</p><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=339 data-injectable=false>As a reader with over half of his bookshelves occupied by an overabundance of thick King hardbacks, allow me to toss a few suggestions out there as to which ones need to get the adaption treatment ASAP, and more specifically where. For the purposes of this article, we’ll solely focus on movies, and save TV shows for another time.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=48 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>In no particular order, here are my picks.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-elevation-2018 data-injectable=false>Elevation (2018)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=687 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=837 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>As the King of Horror, one doesn’t necessarily turn to King’s work for sentimentality or emotion. However, if you’re in the mood for a good cry, Elevation is the book for you, and it would make for a meaningful adaptation. This short novella features Scott Carey, who, similarly to Billy Halleck in Thinner, can’t stop losing weight. This time around, though Scott is not getting thinner, he’s just dropping pounds, meaning his body won’t be able to adhere to the forces of gravity for much longer. Set within the familiar town of Castle Rock, Elevation features a band of characters that will pull at your heartstrings with their compassion and grace. It is also one of the few adaptations that takes a meaningful stab at a positively portrayed LGBTQ couple. If you ask me, this one smells like a Prime Video adaption.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-revival-2014 data-injectable=false>Revival (2014)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Stephen-King-Revival.jpg><p data-characters=666 data-current-count=966 data-injectable=true>Revival is terrifying, I’ll just leave it at that. This 2014 novel came after a particularly noticeable lull in King’s horror roots. A string non-horror releases such as 11/22/63, Under the Dome, and Duma Key left us crying wolf, but King heard our “pfft”-s and returned like a crack of lightning. Literally. Revival is a methodical psychological horror spanning five decades, beginning with the introduction of six-year-old Jamie Morton and Reverend Charles Daniel Jacobs, and ending with a soul-shattering conclusion that will leave you with shivers down your spine and a suffocating hopelessness. To me, this is an A-24 adaptation waiting to happen.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-institute-2019 data-injectable=false>The Institute (2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Institute-by-Stephen-King.jpg><p data-characters=714 data-current-count=1014 data-injectable=true>If there’s one thing King does well it’s tell stories about young protagonists. The Institute isn’t a horror novel in the same sense as It but it does involve a group of kids with supernatural abilities who get abducted and experimented on by a sinister institution hellbent on extracting their gifts. The real horror here are the adults who lack the smallest shred of mercy toward the children they torture, including our main character Luke Ellis. I could totally see a movie adaptation raising the age of thse characters and turning it into a young adult film, but the horror truly lies in how cruel the antagonists are willing to behave to children so young. This has Lionsgate written all over it.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-from-a-buick-8-2002 data-injectable=false>From a Buick 8 (2002)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/From-a-Buick-8-by-Stephen-King-book-cover.jpg><p data-characters=786 data-current-count=1086 data-injectable=true>From a Buick 8 isn’t King’s finest work by any stretch of the imagination, but it remains a beloved addition to his expansive catalog for the sheer nostalgia of its premise. A car that might not actually be just a car is a concept torn straight from the pages of Christine but it’s theme is much more sophisticated. Director Jim Mickle is currently attached to the film adaption but that’s the only shred of information we have to go off of. From a Buick 8 might not turn out to be the best adaptation — heck, I could even see it becoming one of the worst — but that doesn’t change the fact that I want to see this cherry Buick Roadmaster on the big screen. This drips of Columbia Pictures. Or, if we’re talking about a direct-to-streaming studio, I say Netflix.</p><h2 id=h-if-it-bleeds-2020 data-injectable=false>If It Bleeds (2020)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/If-It-Bleeds.jpg><p data-characters=713 data-current-count=1013 data-injectable=true>If It Bleeds is the title story of King’s novella of the same name. Mr. Harrigan’s Phone, also from the novella, was already turned into a Netflix adaptation, for better or for worse, but the real star of the book was without a doubt If It Bleeds starring the one and only <a href=#>Holly Gibney</a> from the Mr. Mercedes trilogy and The Outsider. In this installment, Holly is investigating a bombing. More accurately, the TV correspondent who reported on the bombing. To truly grasp the gravity of this novella, it’s best to have read The Outsider, but either way, If It Bleeds is a perfect follow-up starring one of King’s most vivid characters. This is an Apple TV Plus original, without a doubt.&nbsp;Bye Netflix.</p><h2 id=h-holly-2023 data-injectable=false>Holly (2023)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Stephen-King-Holly-Book.jpg><p data-characters=811 data-current-count=1111 data-injectable=true>Holly Gibney was only a supporting character in the Mr. Mercedes trilogy and The Outsider. She took front and center in If It Bleeds, but she wasn’t truly able to shine in a full-length novel until Holly. Nowadays, she’s working as a private investigator for Finders Keepers, the detective agency formed within the Mr. Mercedes trilogy. The case she’s tasked with this time around involves a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">nasty string of murders involving cannibalism</a>. It also takes place in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, so Holly is King’s most political novel to date. I want to say this should go to Max simply because that’s where The Outsider belongs, but something about it gives me Apple TV Plus vibes too. Either way, Holly is bound to be an adaption sooner or later, and when it does, there will be blood.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-girl-who-loved-tom-gordon-1999 data-injectable=false>The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon (1999)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Girl-Who-Loved-Tom-Gordon.jpg><p data-characters=579 data-current-count=879 data-injectable=true>It’s actually quite shocking that The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon hasn’t been adapted yet. After nine-year-old Trisha is separated from her mother and brother on a hiking trip, she gets lost in the woods, only to curb the spookies by listening to the Boston Red Sox game on her Walkman and imagining that the relief pitcher Tom Gordon is there beside her to guide her through the woods as they becoming increasingly more menacing. In 2020, director Lynne Ramsay became attached to a possible movie adaption for Village Roadshow Pictures, but there’s been no word on it since.</p><h2 id=h-duma-key-2008 data-injectable=false>Duma Key (2008)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Duma-Key-by-Stephen-King-book-cover.jpg><p data-characters=724 data-current-count=1024 data-injectable=true>Duma Key is another novel that’s taken way too long to be adapted. I’ll admit, it might be better suited as a television adaptation rather than a feature film given the size of this bad boy, but if it’s told correctly, this underrated King novel could make for a solid two-and-a-half hours of suspense. It’s another one of those King classics involving a creatively compelled main character, Edgar Freemantle whose loss of his arm in a freak construction accident gives birth to his forgotten passion for painting. Over time, we discover the release Edgar feels in creating these passion projects elicit potentially disastrous outcomes for those around him. This one right here is a Warner Bros. Pictures film.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-the-dark-tower-series data-injectable=false>The Dark Tower series</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/The-Gunslinger-by-Stephen-King-book-cover.jpg><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>Call this a cop-out, whatever, but we need another adaption of King’s Dark Tower series. The 2017 adaption of The Gunslinger starring Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey is notoriously one of the worst things to ever come from a King adaptation, earning a putrid 15% score on Rotten Tomatoes. I don’t trust Sony or Colombia Pictures with this franchise anymore, so why don’t we hand it off to Warner Bros. or New Line Cinema. Possibly even Legendary Pictures.</p><h2 id=h-later-2021 data-injectable=false>Later (2021)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Later-by-Stephen-King-book-cover.jpg><p data-characters=743 data-current-count=1043 data-injectable=true>As much as I wasn’t personally a huge of a fan of King’s Hard Case Crime novel Later, I do have to admit it has adaptation written all over it. In this novel, Jamie Conkin is a kid with supernatural abilities (surprise, surprise), but his mom urges him to keep it a secret. When an NYPD detective shows up with a preternatural warning, it turns out Jamie’s gifts make him the only capable person of saving the day. I’ll admit this book goes off the rails toward the end, but when you figure out the premise you’ll understand why. Do you even care which production company adapts these novels? Let’s just get it adapted! (Oh wait, you do? Fine, this one is Disney… Ha, yeah right, let’s go with Universal Pictures).</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=88 data-injectable=false>While you’re here, check out our list of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">every upcoming Stephen King adaptation</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2Szs7vMZqWerJahtrl506hkmmViaXqpsdGeqmavmJq%2FpnnToZysnV1mfW6%2F056noZ2eYriqusZmmainm2Kupa3PrZitoZ%2BjwG6uxKWmp59f</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrom-netflix-to-a-24-heres-where-these-10-stephen-king-book-adaptations-belong.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffrom-netflix-to-a-24-heres-where-these-10-stephen-king-book-adaptations-belong.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffrom-netflix-to-a-24-heres-where-these-10-stephen-king-book-adaptations-belong.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffrom-netflix-to-a-24-heres-where-these-10-stephen-king-book-adaptations-belong.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrom-netflix-to-a-24-heres-where-these-10-stephen-king-book-adaptations-belong.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrom-netflix-to-a-24-heres-where-these-10-stephen-king-book-adaptations-belong.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-alicia-keys-pregnant.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-alicia-keys-pregnant.html>Is Alicia Keys pregnant?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-david-spade-dating-now-past-relationships-current-relationship-status-and-rumours-html.html>Who is David Spade Dating Now?
