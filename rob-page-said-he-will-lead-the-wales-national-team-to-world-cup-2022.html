Malcolm Page, his father, had formed the Tylorstown Boys football team. Page said that his father formed a squad and that they would drive around on Sundays knocking players out of bed.</p><p>His mother would wash the kits, and their kits would hang out on the washing line every week. Page joined Watford when he was 11 years old when a former Wales international, Tom Walley, discovered him while working in the junior set-up. Page claims it would have been difficult for him if his father had not committed to continuing to take him up to London.</p><h2>His management experience</h2><p>Page retired at the age of 36 in 2011 at Chesterfield. For the second time, he was given a coaching position with League Two team Port Vale in 2011. He was offered for the first time in 2009, but he chose to play for Chesterfield.&nbsp;He was hired as manager of Northampton Town on a three-year deal in 2014, however, he was fired two years later.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rob-Page-3.jpg alt="Rob Page" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The following year, he was appointed manager of Wales’ Under-21 squad. In 2019, he was named as an assistant coach to Ryan Giggs’ Senior Wales side.&nbsp;Giggs was arrested in November 2020, after which he stepped up and assumed leadership with the help of Albert Stuivenberg. Page was appointed manager on May 1st, followed by the World Cup qualifiers.</p><h2>Page is preparing to lead Wales to the World Cup in Qatar.</h2><p>He took over as interim manager after Wales manager Ryan Giggs stepped down in November 2020 after being accused of domestic abuse and facing a trial in August. Despite denying all claims of controlling and abusive conduct towards his former partner Kate Greville and pleading not guilty to all charges, he opted to stand down as Wales national team manager.</p><p>He said in his announcement that he is stepping down as manager of the Wales men’s national team with immediate effect after considerable thought. Rob also added that, although leading his nation has been an honor and pleasure, it is only fair that the Wales FA, coaching staff, and players prepare for the tournament with confidence, clarity, and without uncertainty about their head coach’s status. He closed by wishing the FAW’s players, staff, and fans luck at the World Cup and in the future.</p><p>Page just announced that his contract with Wales has been renewed and that he will lead the squad to the World Cup following qualifying in Qatar.&nbsp;After a 1-0 win against Ukraine, he guided Wales to their first World Cup since 1958.&nbsp;Gareth Bale, widely considered as the greatest Welsh player of all time, said that he believes Page is the long-term management and that there is no doubt in the dressing room or among supporters.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Rob-Page-2.jpg alt="Rob Page" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say that Page had done an outstanding job under challenging circumstances and that everyone had a terrific connection with him. He went on to say,&nbsp;That’s why, when your team is satisfied and your boss is working well, you may do great things.</p><h2>Rob Page Is Married</h2><p>Page is a husband. However, the precise date of their marriage remains unknown. Page seems to have married his wife in a secret wedding ceremony.&nbsp;Page claims to have a very tolerant wife while keeping his personal life out of public.&nbsp;Sheffield is where the family lives. It is unclear how many children Page has since he has kept his personal life private.</p><h2>Net worth</h2><p>Rob Page’s net worth is believed to be between $1 million and $5 million as of October 2023.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGipqJpdpa6osYysmKKcXZ2ybsPIpaNmpJWWsW7Ax55ksJmcmsBuusCtoKimkaF6tbHApmStp12svLO4w2aarqhdZ31zfo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frob-page-said-he-will-lead-the-wales-national-team-to-world-cup-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frob-page-said-he-will-lead-the-wales-national-team-to-world-cup-2022.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frob-page-said-he-will-lead-the-wales-national-team-to-world-cup-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frob-page-said-he-will-lead-the-wales-national-team-to-world-cup-2022.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frob-page-said-he-will-lead-the-wales-national-team-to-world-cup-2022.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frob-page-said-he-will-lead-the-wales-national-team-to-world-cup-2022.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sammy-robinson-new-boyfriend-dating-jordan-simi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sammy-robinson-new-boyfriend-dating-jordan-simi.html>Sammy Robinson New Boyfriend: Is She Dating Jordan Simi In 2023?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sakura-miyawaki-net-worth-318806.html>Sakura Miyawaki Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sakura-miyawaki-net-worth-318806.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
