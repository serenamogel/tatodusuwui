Though the show–revolving around the dysfunctional Wilkerson family–was not the first to depict a lower-middle-class American family with a hilarious set of problems, it was one of the first to break the fourth wall as the show’s lead character, Malcolm, periodically took time to address the audience outside of the Wilkerson family’s wild antics; later inspiring shows like Modern Family to introduce their own unique approach to the fourth wall.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=333 data-current-count=333 data-injectable=false>After earning critical acclaim from both critics and audiences, Malcolm in the Middle continued to air on Fox for seven seasons before finally ending in 2006. Since then, the cast have moved on to focus on other endeavors; with some achieving incredible Hollywood success, while others have opted to leave the spotlight altogether.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=664 data-injectable=true>Years later, the cast is still fondly remembered for their time on Malcolm in The Middle.
