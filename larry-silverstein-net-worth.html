worth over<strong> $10 billion.</strong></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>It has nearly <strong>16 million</strong> square feet of commercial, residential, and retail space spread across ten Manhattan, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles office towers.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Similarly, it has a 443-unit luxury hotel in Orlando and two prosperous rental buildings in Midtown Manhattan with 2,280 units total.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nine million square feet of construction are currently placed under the company.</span></p><p>Moreover, Larry sold the 711 Fifth Avenue building to Coca-Cola for <strong>$57.6 million </strong>in 1983, turning a profit of over <strong>$46 million.&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><span data-preserver-spaces=true>World

One, Two, Four, and Five as well as 425,000 square feet of commercial space.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Silverstein contributed <strong>$14 million</strong> of his personal funds to

was two separate incidents rather than one.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Nine insurers were exposed to the “two occurrences” rather than the “one occurrence” interpretation in two trials due to the legal battle.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In 2007, a settlement was reached, and insurers promised to cover <strong>$4.55 billion</strong>, way less than what
