It was released by Darkroom, an imprint of Interscope Records. It was written and produced by her brother, Finneas O’Connell, with whom she works on music and live shows. Don’t Smile at Me, her first EP, was a commercial success. It was in the top 15 in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, among other places.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Are Billie Eilish And Jesse Rutherford Dating?</h2><p>Even though <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jesse </a>and Billie have only been seen together a few times, it is not clear if they are dating or not. Also, neither singer has confirmed rumors that they are <a href=#>dating</a>. But the pictures of them kissing in L.A. are proof in and of themselves!</p><p>Billie told Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp in September 2020 that she wants to keep her relationships private. “I want to keep my relationships private for sure. I’ve had relationships that I’ve kept secret, and even the ones I’ve had that I’ve let the world know a little bit about, I regret,” she said. “I think about people who have made their relationships public, and then they break up.</p><p>It’s like, ‘What if it goes bad?'” Then everyone has an opinion about your relationship that has nothing to do with the truth. It’s not something I want to know about.”</p><p>Before she was with Jesse, Billie was with Matthew Tyler Vorce from 2021 until May 2022, when Matthew confirmed that they were no longer together.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Is Jesse Rutherford?</h2><p>Jesse is a singer-songwriter who is best known for being the lead singer of the alternative rock band The Neighbourhood. Together with the rest of his band, Jesse wrote “Sweater Weather,” which topped the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and went 5 Platinum in the USA in 2020.</p><p>Jesse has been in the entertainment business since he was a child. He has been in commercials and a few movies, like Bundy in 2002 and Life or Something Like It. He also had a small part in the episode “Marauders” of Star Trek: Enterprise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-168-1024x683.png><p>As a teenager, he was the lead singer of several bands. In 2011, he put out a mixtape called “Truth Hurts, Truth Heals,” which inspired him and other band members to start The Neighborhood. The band’s first song, “Female Robbery,” came out in 2012. It was followed by “Sweater Weather,” both of which were on their first studio album, “I Love You.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Has Dated Jesse Rutherford?</h2><p>From 2015 to 2021, Jesse was in a very public relationship with model and co-founder of Wildflower Cases Devon Lee Carlson. Fans loved the couple because they often posted photos and videos of each other on social media, and Devon was called “the quintessential rock star girlfriend.” Devon was in the music video for “Stargazing” by Jesse, which inspired many fans to dress up as Devon and Jesse from the video for Halloween.</p><p>Together, GQ Magazine chose them as “2019’s most 2019 couple.” They worked with Marc Jacobs in 2020 to make a limited-edition Valentine’s Day T-shirt. It was gone in a few minutes. Several sources said, though, that the couple broke up in November 2021, after dating for six years. Devon confirmed the breakup on the Call Her Daddy podcast in September 2022, which was almost a year after the breakup.</p><p>Love J-14?
