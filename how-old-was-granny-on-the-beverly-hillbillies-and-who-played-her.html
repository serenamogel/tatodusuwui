Her hilarious hijinks included everything from witty retorts to catching raccoons for “supper.” When the show premiered in 1962 on CBS it was a huge hit, due in no small part to the lovable character of Granny. While it did include other high-profile celebrities such as Buddy Ebsen as Jed and Erika Eleniak as Ellie May, Granny was immediately a fan favorite.</p><h2 id=h-who-played-granny-on-the-beverly-hillbillies data-injectable=false>Who played Granny on the Beverly Hillbillies?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/granny.jpg><p data-characters=513 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>The<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> black and white series </a>premiered in 1962 and Granny was played by acclaimed actress <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Irene Ryan</a></strong>. Irene was a Texas native who had made her way up through the Hollywood ranks via Broadway, radio, and finally, television. She was known as an actress, comedian, and radio personality. Later she would go on to win a Tony for her work in the 1974 hit Pippin, and an Emmy for her time on The Beverly Hillbillies. While she had found some success before appearing on the show, it was considered to be her big break.</p><p data-characters=555 data-current-count=555 data-injectable=true>In fact, prior to her time on the Hillbillies she revealed she had often lived in hotels and it had become somewhat of her norm. The show rocketed her to fame and fortune but she shared in a 1965 interview with the Star Gazette that her fears of being fired were always present. She reported she would be the “first one on set” every day because she was so terrified of losing her place on the show. Despite the repeated assurances of producers and the immensely positive response from fans, Ryan would hold that fear until the final episode.</p><p data-characters=373 data-current-count=373 data-injectable=false>In an effort to ease her fears, one of the show’s producers Paul Henning even bought her a miniature golden rocking chair studded with diamonds. He presented it to her as a token of both gratitude for her performance and a sort of emblem of her permanent place on the set. While Ryan was reportedly grateful she still held her doubts throughout the time on the show.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How old was Granny on the Beverly Hillbillies?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/irene-ryan-2.jpg><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=538 data-injectable=true>Daisy “Granny” Moses (sometimes Clampett) was portrayed to be an elderly woman in her 80s. Although spunky and active, she was meant to be the older matriarch of the family rounding the corner toward 90 as the show approached its end. While the character of Granny was portrayed as being an elderly woman in her 80s, the actress who played her — Irene Ryan — was actually much younger. At the time she was cast in 1962 Irene Ryan she was only 59 years old. The show ran until 1971 when she would have been approaching 70.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=412 data-injectable=true>Ryan’s elderly appearance on the set was the result of movie magic and apparently a ton of makeup. The additional wrinkles and shadows made Ryan almost unrecognizable but allowed her to fully step into the role of America’s favorite backcountry-turned-Beverly Hills grandmother. It was a makeup process that quickly caught on and was then repeated in several later series including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Golden Girls.</a></p><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>Even following the end of the Beverly Hillbillies, Ryan continued acting and went on to win a Tony for her Pippin performance although she fell ill while working on the project. Irene passed away in 1973 at the age of 70 with a reported net worth of $2 million. It seems her fears of being fired and returning to a life of poverty would never come to pass. She would die wealthy, successful, and well-loved.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S1sMOMqKOdZaeWwG6z0Zqlp7FdpLtuwMeeZJudppq%2FrcWMoaClpJKeua21xKxkmqaUYsSpu4ypo5qxlZl6qbHRaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-old-was-granny-on-the-beverly-hillbillies-and-who-played-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-old-was-granny-on-the-beverly-hillbillies-and-who-played-her.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-old-was-granny-on-the-beverly-hillbillies-and-who-played-her.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-old-was-granny-on-the-beverly-hillbillies-and-who-played-her.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-old-was-granny-on-the-beverly-hillbillies-and-who-played-her.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-old-was-granny-on-the-beverly-hillbillies-and-who-played-her.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./keke-palmers-ex-darius-jackson-claims-actress-was-abusive-in-own-filing.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./keke-palmers-ex-darius-jackson-claims-actress-was-abusive-in-own-filing.html>Keke Palmers ex Darius Jackson claims actress was abusive in own filing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chris-licht-bio-age-parents-wife-children-worth.html>Chris Licht Bio, Age, Parents, Wife, Children, Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chris-licht-bio-age-parents-wife-children-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
