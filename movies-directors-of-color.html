In Mira Nair's first feature film, Salaam Bombay! (1988), she turned to<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/0602-Summer-2006/Independent-Voice-Mira-Nair.aspx data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" documentary filmmaking techniques" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60"> documentary filmmaking techniques</a> to make a movie about a preteen surviving in the slums of Mumbai, India. Despite initial difficulty finding an Indian distributor, the film earned an Oscar <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dga.org/Craft/DGAQ/All-Articles/0602-Summer-2006/Independent-Voice-Mira-Nair.aspx data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=nomination class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">nomination</a> for best foreign language film.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After that film’s success, Nair wanted to direct a love story featuring an Indian woman from Uganda and an African American man, but the project hit snags along the way, including an executive wanting the film to feature a white protagonist. Nair countered that the film's waiters could be white. In the end, she was able to make Mississippi Masala (1991).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since then, Nair has made a<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mira-Nair data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" variety of movies" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60"> variety of movies</a>. "Right from the beginning, I've always gone to stories when I feel that I can tell them in a special way, that they're mine, that they won’t let me go," she said of her choice of projects.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Nair’s style of filmmaking imbues familiar western storylines with eastern sensibilities—both on screen and on set. Her cast and crew are said to do an hour or more of yoga before shooting every day whenever possible, which she said “irons us out, and creates this atmosphere of calm and focus. There are no tantrums on my sets, no raised voices.”</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">John Singleton</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">John Singleton grew up in South Central Los Angeles, where he could see a<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/obituaries/john-singleton-dead.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=" drive-in theater" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60"> drive-in theater</a> from his mother's apartment, and watched B movies out the window, without the sound.

Singleton wanted to pave the way for Black creatives wherever possible—or, as he put it, “I want to do for the movie business what Jay-Z did in the music business,” he told The Los Angeles Times in 2006. Until his death at the age of 51 in 2019, Singleton consistently advocated for more diversity in the film industry.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Ang Lee</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ang Lee was born in Taiwan and graduated from NYU's film school in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ang-Lee data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=1984 class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">1984</a>. For the rest of the decade, he tried, and failed, to pitch Hollywood his ideas. His breakthrough moment came when two scripts he entered in a Taiwanese screenplay contest received first and second place and resulted in his first two movies getting made.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lee showcased generational conflict in Chinese families in Tui Shou (Pushing Hands, 1992), Hsi Yen (The Wedding Banquet, 1993) and Yinshi nan nu (Eat Drink Man Woman, 1994). The success of these films led to the opportunity to direct Sense and Sensibility (1995), based on the Jane Austen novel.
