However, Ash’s mum comes in, and tells Ash to go bed, although letting him watch a lecture on tv in the meantime. At night, he dreams of the starter pokemon, but he breaks his alarm clock in his sleep, and he is late. He then runs all the way to Professor Oak’s lab. Outside the lab, Ash gets through the crowd, who are all cheering on his lifelong rival; Gary Oak. After showing off his starter, he drives off to start on his journey. Meanwhile, Professor Oak comes out to meet Ash, who is eager to ge this starter. After finding out that all the other pokemon had been chosen already, the professor finally gives Ash a ‘shocking’ partner; Pikachu, the electric mouse. After ‘sparking’ a bad relationship, Ash and his partner start off their journey, at Route 1. Once Ash listens to the pokedex, he learns to be kinder to Pikachu, and starts off by taking its lead off. Ash then sets his eyes on a wild Pidgey. However, Pikachu won’t attack it, and instead runs off, leaving Ash to fight it on his own.</p><p>However, the Pidgey easily escapes Ash’s first pokeball, but he learns from the pokedex that he must fight it using a pokemon. He then traps it with his pyjama shirt, and then tries to catch it, but just like the first time, it proves to be unsuccesful. After a Rattata rummages through his belongings, he unleashes all his rage upon a group of Pidgey, throwing a rock at them. A Spearow appears, but thinking it’s a Pidgey, Ash throws a rock at it also, enraging it. It then wrongly tries to attack Pikachu, who uses Thundershock on it so that it can’t attack it. A flock of Spearow then tries to attack Ash and Pikachu, who run towards a river, jumping straight in. Meanwhile, Misty is fishing, and fishes up Ash and his Pikachu, who jump straight on Misty’s bike without asking. Ash cycles away from the Spearow at a high speed. After falling off the bike, Pikachu jumps up from Ash’s shoulder, and defeats the entire Spearow flock. After the trouble is over, Ash witnesses a legendary pokemon flying in the sky, although the pokedex couldn’t recognize it. They finally get to Viridian City, ready to heal up Pikachu.</p><p>After the synopsis, I will say my thoughts on it, and then I will note the dub edits, animation errors, my opinion on it out of ten, etc. So what do you think about it?

Bulbapedia isn't really the place to discuss something like this, especially when there's a lot of back and forth that inevitably happens when starting a new column. I'd prefer to talk about it over e-mail, which you can find via the "E-mail this user" option on the side of my userpage.

I'm new on this wiki. I've been always a fan of Pokémon and each newcoming generation makes my heart explode of joy...and because of this I wanted to signalate you something that I noted repeting each generation. In each generation I noted that there are a series of Pokémon who share a lot things in common with each other. I called them the "Local Bugs" and the "Local Birds".From what I noted the Local Bugs are a group of Pokémon who, hence the name, are all bug-typed. In each generation appear two final evolution of this bug-types who are conterpart to each other. The Local Birds are instead a group of Pokémon based on birds who are a always Normal/Flying type. In each generation the Local Bugs are: Butterfree & Beedrill in Generation I, Ledian & Ariados in Generation II, Beautifly & Dustox in Generation III, Wormadam & Mothim in Generation IV and Hahakomori & Pendora in Generation V. The Local Birds are: Pidgeot in Generation I, Noctowl in Generation II, Swellow in Generation III, Staraptor in Generation IV and Kenhorou in Generation V. I've also noted that the Local Bugs and the Local Birds are strictly related in terms of evolution: in Generation I Butterfree, Beedrill and Pidgeot are in a two-stages evolutionary line and in Generation II Noctowl, Ledian and Ariados are in one-stage evolutionary line. In Generation III Beautifly and Dustox are in a two-stages branched evolutionary line meanwhile Swelllow is in a one-stage evolutionary line. Counterwise, in generation IV Staraptor is in a two-stages evolutionary line meanwhile Wormadam and Mothim are in a one-stage branched evolutionary line. In Generation V, same as Generation I, Kenhorou, Hahakomori and Pendora are in a two-stages evolutionary line. Of coursely I don't think to be the only one who noted this, but I would like if you can take in consideration my opinion to write an article about this (I can't, because honestly if I will write this article this would be my first article, and I don't want to ruined the articles).
