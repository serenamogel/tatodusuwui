The filing also cited an instance in which she allegedly “called him over 200 times and sent him over 50 emails” after Jackson “told her he would not spend the night with her” in November 2021.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10>Jackson, a fitness instructor, claimed in the docs that he changed his phone number in March 2020 in order “to avoid further harassment and threats” from Palmer, who he said “frequently became agitated and aggressive after consuming alcohol.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The pair share a 9-month-old son named Leo. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>The Post has contacted reps for Palmer for comment.</p><p>Last month, Palmer said in legal docs that she had <a href=#>security camera footage</a> from an incident on Nov. 5. where Jackson allegedly “trespassed into my home without my knowledge or consent” and “threatened” her before “lunging for my neck, striking me, throwing me over the couch and stealing my phone.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Palmer recently posted this clip to social media amid the legal battle. <span class=credit>Keke Palmer/Instagram</span></figure><p>She alleged multiple instances of “physical violence” that endangered herself and their son, describing her former partner “destroying my personal property, including diaries and prescription eyeglasses, throwing my belongings into the street, throwing my car keys to prevent me from driving away, hitting [me] in front of our son, spewing profanities about me to our son, threatening to kill himself with a gun if I left him, harassment and other physical and emotional abuse.”</p><p>Last week, Palmer shared a reel of herself holding their baby, stating that her life was “unraveling at the seams.”</p><p>She wrote over the Instagram video, set to Nicki Minaj’s 2021 song “Seeing Green,” that “when reality tv makes everyone believe all celebrities’ lives are just one big marketing strategy and scheme but my life is truly unraveling at the seams and I just wear trauma like a dolce gabanna coat because Sharon [her mother] didn’t raise no b***.”</p><p>Palmer and Jackson made a joint statement earlier this month to<a href=#> delay their restraining order hearing</a>, which was set for Dec. 5, to “allow the parties time to attend mediation.” The statement further stipulated that “the parties request that the Mediation and Petitioner’s DVRO be continued to a mutually agreeable date.”</p><p class=postsid
