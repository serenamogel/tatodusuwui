Everything in the photograph has been studied, from the breadth of his legs to the curvature of his ankles and even the way he ties his shoelaces.</p><p>Many others saw what seemed to be a mole, freckle, or mark from an intravenous line on his hand, which they thought may suggest he had recently undergone surgery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jeffree-Star-Leaks-Saryn-Andersons-DM-Over-NFL-Boyfriend-Drama.jpg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Jeffree Star has been teasing his NFL boyfriend on Twitter.

However, many are speculating it to be Henry.&nbsp;</p><p>Henry is the defensive end for the Carolina Panthers of the NFL and is 6’6” tall. Similarly, his team did not make it to SuperBowl this year, leading to rumors of him being Star’s mystery beau.</p><p>Following the rumors, Henry’s wife since 2019, Saryn, texted Star on Instagram. She replied to his story, saying the public was harassing her because they believed her husband to be Star’s beau.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>OMG now the <a href=# rel=noopener>#NFL</a> wives are coming after me!!!

Little is known about their purported romance, with rumors claiming it was only a fling.&nbsp;</p><p>Skateboarder Nathan Schwandt is Star’s longest and most public relationship. They dated for five years, from March 2015 to January 2020, after Schwandt snuck into the beauty guru’s Instagram DMs.&nbsp;</p><p>Star frequently uploaded videos of the couple’s lives, which they lived with a family of Pomeranians. Unfortunately, their relationship did not last long.</p><p>Star released a 17-minute YouTube video titled ‘We Broke Up’ in January 2020 to announce the couple’s split sadly. The beauty guru listed various reasons for the breakup, including Schwandt’s distaste for the spotlight, losing one of their dogs, and family health issues.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jeffree and Nate had been rock solid for 5 years inspite of all the rumours and shit.

Neither announced an official relationship, and Star soon began seeing someone else.</p><p>Basketball player Andre Marhold became Star’s boyfriend in the summer of 2020. The beauty mogul initially concealed Marhold’s identity by uploading a photo of himself sitting on the lap of a man whose face fans couldn’t see.</p><p>However, online detectives took little time to deduce Marhold’s identity based on his unusual arm tattoos. Once their secret was out, Star began posting images of the couple together.</p><p>However, their short-lived relationship was filled with drama, with Star accusing his beau of stealing from him. Since then, Star has been teasing that he is dating someone but has not revealed his identity.&nbsp;</p><h1 class="mvp-post-title left">Teenage Rapper Lil Purk to Serve 20 Years in Prison for Atlantic Station Double Murder</h1><span class="mvp-post-excerpt left"><p>Lil Purk has been jailed 20 years in prison.</p></span><img width=1200 height=720 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Lil-Purk-Arrested.jpg alt="Teenage Rapper Lil Purk to Serve 20 Years in Prison for Atlantic Station Double Murder" decoding=async sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Teenage Rapper Lil Purk, real name Antonio Jackson, has been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">jailed</a> for 20 years in prison for a deadly shooting near Atlantic Station in November 2022.</p><p>Five of the six defendants, Lil Purk, Demetrius Hill, Toney Wilson, Deandre Forston, and DeRodney Russell, entered negotiated guilty pleas, their sentences ranging from 20 to 40 years.&nbsp;</p><p>The rapper was sentenced to 20 years, with 10 years to be served in custody and 10 years on probation.
